# game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life implemented in Rust and WebAssembly.

## Acknowledgments
This game follows a tutorial made by the team at Mozilla. The majority of this repository was not authored by myself; however, I do make some adjustments of my own. The goal for this repository was to learn WebAssembly + Rust :)
